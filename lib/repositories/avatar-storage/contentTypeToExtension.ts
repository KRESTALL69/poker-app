// LocalAvatarStorageRepository needs a real file extension in the on-disk
// filename -- nginx serves /storage/ as static files and infers
// Content-Type from the extension, unlike Supabase Storage (which remembers
// whatever Content-Type was given at upload time regardless of the object
// key). The avatar upload route already validates contentType.startsWith("image/")
// before calling uploadAvatar(), so this only has to cover the shapes that
// are actually produced (browser file uploads) -- anything else falls back
// to jpg rather than failing the upload.
